PLANET 1
Hello world!
My name is Odo.
I lihve here on stage. 
welcome to my body, 
this is my body. 
I do not lihve in a body like you, 
I do not lihve on a planet like you,
I am the planet, 
I am. the planet. 
called Odo.
Do not think of me as a light bulb. 
I do not need to be replaced, 
even though living can be stressful at times.
Hi everybody, 
we will spend some time together, 
so. . .
Welcome to my planet!



PLANET 2
A man fell to the earth.
He was a very small man,
almost a child,
he came from a distant planet
hardly bigger than himself.
Another man fell from the sky.
He was a pilot,
his plane crashed in the middle of the desert.
There they met,
the pilot and the planet-man.
It’s very warm up there,
said the planet-man. 
I am thirsty. . .



PANET2 WAVE GAME
Push water to the center of stage!
You call that a wave?
Should I show you what a wave is?
This. . . .
is ... a... wave. . .



PLANET3
In the 13th galaxy,
solar system x dash 3,
on planet 15 underscore 2,
in the city X plus III,
13th street,
number 13,
lihve Mr. and Mrs. Thirteen.
The number 13 occurs very often in their lihves
but they dont notice it.
In 13 years they will die,
of course on a 13th,
13 o'clock on the dot,
just another stupid coincidence
without any magic.



PLANET4
In another world,
people lihve in a cave.
They never leave the cave,
the world outside the cave
are shadows and reflections to them
with no idea about another world.
One day one person escapes from the cave.
He climbs out,
for the first time he sees the world
with his own eyes…



PLANET4 GAME PLANE
help him! Level the ground. . .



PLANET5
Things dont stay still,
everything is turning,
stars turn on and off.
Maybe
time becomes meaningless.
Maybe
time has just began.
Anyway...
We all came together,
this is important,
we lihve in the moment,
we lihve now,
lets celebrate this moment,
lets move, breathe, lihve...
Lets dance!



PLANET6
lets build a landscape together!
a landscape you’ve never seen before,
a vision,
a landscape of this moment,
a new planet,
the planet of your ever beating heart.



PLANET6 GAMELANDSCAPE
Move to a location.
pull hills and push valleys with your Odo phones. . .



PLANET 6 END
You are a part of my life now.
You built me a planet
of your ever beating hearts...
I will never forget you.
Take care.
Good-bye...
